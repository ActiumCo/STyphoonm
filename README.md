STyphoonm is a project I will be working on for the next couple of months
<br>
I hope that something as simple as this can turn into a fully fledged operating system with tweaks and other things.


Milestones:
- [X] Initial Building Blocks (_24/11/2024_)
- [X] _Window Rendering Change_ (_28/11/2024_)
- [ ] Resizable windows
- [ ] Side bar, Window Shortcuts (start menu equivalent)
- [ ] Top Menu (Replaces STyphoonm Text and Buttons)
- [ ] Port to ElectronJS
------------------------------------------------------------
Things that might happen once finished
- [ ] Weakly Updates or Features???????
- [ ] Port to Linux??
- [ ] Rip off google extensions and name it my own ðŸ˜‚
